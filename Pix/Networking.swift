//  Networking.swift
//  PlanIt
//
//  This file contains methods that make saving, loading and just in general using Firebase easier. It
//  contains methods that perform very specific functions in our Firebase database, however they are
//  written so that anyone who isn't familiar with Firebase can still save and load data.
//
//  The class contains only static methods, which means that to use them you must call them by saying 
//  something like this:
//
//  func someFunction() {
//      Networking.methodName(parameters);
//  }
//
//
//  
//  Also note that some methods may return different values. These values can be used elsewhere in the 
//  app if it is deemed necessary.
